        "\n",
        "Real-world datasets often have missing values: this can be due to hardware faults (e.g., a sensor failing), data corruption, ambiguity, or even by design (think about surveys with optional questions). In Python, the special value `NaN` (not-a-number) can be used to indicate a missing value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dealing with missing data is not straightforward. One option is to *remove* any sample with missing features $x_{i}$ (or label $y$). However, there are several datasets for which *almost all* samples have one or more missing feature values, and we would be throwing away all the information contained in the non-missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this problem, we explore the use of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm for *data imputation*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose that you are solving a regression problem where **the only potential missing values are response labels $y^{(i)}$**. Describe a method, based on the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, to fill-in missing values based on the available response labels. When do you expect your method to work well, and when do you expect it to produce poor results? Justify your answers and design choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 2\n",
        "Implement your method from Question 1 by completing the provided code snippet in `p1.py` (in the `KnnLabelImputer` class) and **submit it to Gradescope**. You can use the `regression_dataset_with_missing_responses` function, provided in the next code cell, to generate example inputs to help with development.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 3\n",
        "Now, suppose that we are solving a *classification* problem, and we know that *no labels $y^{(i)}$ are missing*. However, there are now missing *feature* values. Like in **Question 1**, describe a method based on the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm for performing data imputation on the features of the dataset. You can assume that there are enough samples for each distinct class label. When do you expect your method to work well, and when not to? Justify your answers and design choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tip**: The nearest neighbors implementation in `scikit-learn` allows you to define your own distance function via the `metric` parameter. You can use this to define a distance function that takes into account missing values and class membership. Think about how you can modify the distance function to favor samples with the same class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 4\n",
        "Implement your method from Question 3 by completing the provided code template in `p1.py` (in the `KnnFeatureImputer` class) and **submit it to Gradescope**. You can use the `classification_dataset_with_missing_features` function from the following cell to generate example inputs to help with development."

        "Q1 Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "A method based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to fill in missing values based on the availavble response labels would be to average the k nearest neighbors values to come up with one. For example if one x has no y value, then you average the y values of nearby x that do not have missing y's. Do this for a small set of neighbors in a close range and you can come up with a fairly accurate y for the missing value. I would expect this to work well when y varies smoothly together. For example in a straight line it would be easy to average nearby y values to get a value compared to y values that are all over the place. Also if the data is dense then you don't have to average over that wide of a range of (x,y) value pairs. Compared to when the data is spread out it becomes less accurate. If there are too many y values missing I would expect this to do poorly as well. Like if all of the neighbors also had their y values missing.\n",

        "\n",
        "A method based on the k-nearest neighbors algorith for performing data imputation on the features of the data set would start by finding the values of the features in the same class of labels. Given many feature per label we can use the distance function to figure out how far away the rest of the features in the class are. Given this information we can select the k nearest features of other labels and then average their values of our missing feature. We take this average and it becomes the missing feature value.\n",

        "\n",
        "> An aerospace engineer is tasked with creating and fine-tuning a classifier that processes post-flight images of aircraft wings and screens them for the presence of fractures. To train the classifier, they are given access to a dataset of labeled images ($0$ indicates no fracture, $1$ indicates fracture). Following the advice of an LLM, the engineer writes a `scikit-learn` pipeline that:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> - pre-processes the data, splits them into $K = 20$ folds using the built-in `KFold` class\n",
        "> - trains several logistic regression models, one for each fold, and\n",
        "> - selects the best model based on the estimated (via cross-validation) F1 score.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> However, 5 years after they deploy their model, maintenance engineers suggest that it failed to detect several fractures, leading to higher degradation of the aircraft and many more dollars lost. **What went wrong?**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A likely answer is that the dataset is very imbalanced. Specifically, wings are usually structurally intact after flight; unless special care was taken while curating the dataset, most labels will be negative and many folds will not contain any samples from the positive class. Therefore, it is possible that a classifier that always outputs \"negative\" leads to good F1 score as estimated via cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix this, we augment K-fold cross validation with the idea of **stratified** sampling. Stratified sampling splits the data in a way that approximately preserves the fraction of class labels within each fold. In `scikit-learn`, this is easy to implement via the `StratifiedKFold` class.\n",

Train a logistic regression classifier using (a) `KFold` and (b) `StratifiedKFold` cross-validation for different values of $K$, and plot the resulting F1 score as a function of the number of folds $K$. Are the results expected or surprising, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note**: you can implement the cross-validation yourself or use the built-in `cross_val_score` function from `scikit-learn` or use the `LogisticRegressionCV` model with the appropriate cross-validation generator.\n",

        "## Question 2\n",

This is because as there is more folds there is a higher chance a fold has no fracture case to train on in the K-fold case. When the number of folds go up there is less data per fold and thus less to train on. This makes it harder for the model to be accurate when in use and decreases the F1 score.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stratified K-fold helps this effect by ensuring that each fold atleast has some positive and some negative samples. This ensures a higher F1 score in the begining but as it increases higher it goes much lower just like the regular K-fold.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall the Stratified K-Fold held for a few more folds at a higher value than the standard K-fold did. While not having a massive difference this is still very beneficial.\n",

        "\n",
        "For this specific application it could be helpful. In trying to see if airplaine wings are fractured you probably want a high false positive rate rather than a false negative (there is a fracture and not detected). However overall this is not a good practice. It may still be very inacurate if there are too many folds and the F1 is very low. Meaning it still may not detect anything. This solution is like putting a band-aid on a bulet wound, there is a deeper issue that should be adressed via stratifiedKfold instead."

        "# Problem 3: dimension reduction via random projections\n",
        "\n",
        "In class, we discussed how PCA discovers a few important degrees of freedom of high-dimensional datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea was the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *If data are mostly contained on a low-dimensional subspace, let's discover that subspace and project the data onto it.*\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of principal components, $k$ reflects our \"guess\" for the dimension of that subspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another dimension reduction method featuring prominently in theoretical computer science is that of so-called \"random projections\". Setting the stage, suppose we have $n$ data points living in $d$-dimensional space ($\\mathbb{R}^d$ for simplicity). The random projections method proceeds as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Generate $k$ vectors, $g^{(1)}, \\dots, g^{(k)}$, randomly (often according to a Gaussian distribution).\n",
        "- Arrange these vectors as the columns of a matrix:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\Pi := \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "\tg^{(1)} & \\cdots & g^{(k)}\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "- For each of the $n$ points in your dataset, say $x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n)}$:\n",
        "\t- Compute the product $\\widetilde{x}^{(i)} = \\Pi^{\\top} x^{(i)}$.\n",
        "- This results in a matrix $\\widetilde{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ containing the \"reduced\" dataset.\n",
        "- Downstream tasks (e.g., regression or classification) can be performed on the reduced dataset instead.\n",
        "    - Any new data point $x$ can be projected to $\\widetilde{x} := \\Pi^{\\top} x$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The random projections method works because the matrix $\\Pi$ produces \"low distortion\": for all pairs $i \\neq j$,\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "(1 - \\varepsilon) \\|x^{(i)} - x^{(j)}\\| \\leq \\| \\widetilde{x}^{(i)} - \\widetilde{x}^{(j)}\\| \\leq (1 + \\varepsilon) \\|x^{(i)} - x^{(j)}\\|,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "whenever the number of the random vectors $k$ satisfies the following inequality:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "k \\geq \\frac{10 \\log(n)}{\\varepsilon^2}.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that the ambient dimension, $d$, **does not appear** in the bound at all! This result is known in the literature as the *Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma*.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will explore the use of random projections with 2 different variants: one where the random vectors are dense, and one where the random vectors are *sparse* (i.e., mostly zeros). Then, you will compare the quality of the resulting embeddings with that provided by principal component analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Download the code template `p3.py`. You will find two functions with the following code signatures:\n",

        "Q2 Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "A. The behavior of these quantities is not surprising as k increases. This is not surprising due to the equations provided. As k increases the ratio decreases, as k is in the denominator. As the equations show the method works because the distances from 1 are always (1+ratio, or 1-ratio). So it makes sense that our graph shows movement towards one on both sides as k increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "B. It is not surprising that the sparse projections are further from 1 than the dense ones. This is because the sparse line uses fewer inputs per point. Thus it gives more of a rough estimate of the line. The dense line uses every iunput so it is very set. Also the reason the lower sparse line is not as varied is because there are fewer inputs points to choose from, making it less likely it gets a wild output. It also makes sense that both get closer to 1 as k increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "C. If you have a ton of rows but only a few columnns, large and small d, I would not reccomend this method. If d is already small there is no need to reduce it further. Instead it may actually take a lot of time to reduce d when n is so large (and for litle gain). Other methods are more efficent.\n",

The dataset comprises responses to a CDC survey. The code in the cell below splits the dataset into features and labels, resulting in a binary classification task. For this problem, your only deliverable should be a Jupyter notebook that implements all the necessary code and addresses the following questions:\n",

        "## Question 1\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains numeric, nominal and ordinal features. Which features fall into which category, and how should we preprocess each category?\n",

        "## Question 2\n",
        "\n",
        "Train a classifier for the binary classification task, and report the average accuracy and Area-Under-Curve (AUC) using 5-fold cross-validation. Does this problem warrant using additional metrics, such as the F1 score, in addition to accuracy? Why or why not?\n",

        "**Note**: You are allowed to choose any model suitable for binary classification you want, in addition to those you have already seen in class. You are welcome to peruse the scikit-learn documentation for additional models, if you want to try them out.\n",

This means it averages out the two and shows if one is way higher than the other. If both are high than the f1 score is high. In this case the f1 score is high so it shows us the model is high in precision and recall.\n",

Also to improve the method we could use a stratified k-fold instead of a normal k-fold. As explored previously it would increase the F1 score as it ensures each fold has atleast a few of each cases."
